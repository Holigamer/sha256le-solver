# sha256le_brainforce
A simple (and kinda scrappy) algorithm bundle to solve the sha256le wordle game variant by keftcha in more or less 16 steps

## How do I use this mythological tool of superpower?

#### Install

You need [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), a current [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/new/) version and the [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).

To simplify: use `pip install -U selenium` to install selenium in ur venv and place the unpacked geckodriver exe in the python folder you have your main.py in. (Bonus Points if you have firefox already installed)

#### Usage

Just comment out the algorithm u want to use and hit run. Firefox will open a new window automatically and execute. Have fun.
